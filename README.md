# Jira Branch Description

Display Jira issue details obtained from branches in the VS Code Source Control (SCM) view.

This extension enhances the SCM view by extracting Jira issue keys from your branch names and displaying relevant issue details directly within VS Code.

## Features

- Extracts Jira issue IDs from branch names using a configurable regex pattern.
- Displays issue summaries, statuses, types, priorities, and assignees in a dedicated "Jira Branches" view within the SCM panel.
- Provides inline icons on hover/selection to quickly copy the issue key or open the issue in Jira.
- Updates issue information (respecting cache settings).
- Supports offline caching for Jira issue details.
- Configurable Jira connection details, branch pattern, cache settings, and number of branches to fetch.

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.80.0 or higher
- Git initialized in your workspace
- Jira account with API access
